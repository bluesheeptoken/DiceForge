# Dice Forge

Small but functional app to estimate gold incomes depending on your dices for the game "Dice Forge".

This app helps you to estimate the odds to have at least X gold after your rolls.

Quite helpful to estimate when to start filling your hammer or when to pay for your ancient.

The app can be found running [here](https://share.streamlit.io/bluesheeptoken/diceforge/app.py).
